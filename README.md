# calculator

A rather complex project indeed. My solution is far from perfect, but I haven't looked at others. Need to add keyboard input. 

17.05.22 - 1.0 ver (without keyboard input) <br>
29.05.22 - 1.1 ver (with keyboard and numpad support).<br> ***remainder*** I have to clean a lot of mess in the code, because i copy/paste a lot of staff and this can be done cleaner.
